# üè∑Ô∏è Financial Named Entity Recognition with FinBERT

Manual tagging of financial entities in earnings reports and 10-K filings is labor-intensive and error-prone. This project seeks to automate the identification of domain-specific financial entities using FinBERT, a transformer model pretrained on financial corpora.
This project fine-tunes [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert), a domain-specific transformer model, to perform token-level Named Entity Recognition (NER) on financial disclosures. Using the [Financial-NER-NLP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Josephgflowers/Financial-NER-NLP) dataset, the model learns to extract structured financial entities such as interest rates, borrowing capacity, and equity instruments from unstructured financial statements.
